  "Tvisha is a rising junior who fell in love with reading and literature when she was a little girl. An avid reader whose favorite genres include thriller and sci-fi, Tvisha is always on the lookout for her next read. She’s been part of and led various book clubs in the past, including ones at the Cupertino Library, her middle school, and her elementary school in India. Some of her favorite novels include Every Last Word and This is Our Story. When she’s not reading a book, Tvisha manages a book review website, competes as part of her school’s Speech and Debate team, and goes to the gym.",
  "June is excited to serve as Bookshelf's Vice President. While she is a lover of all cultures and paralleling literature, she consistently turns to mythology and dramatic short stories as her comfort reads. In her free time, she virtually browses art collections (her favorite being those exploring identity from The Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan) and tries her best to explore the unspoken through dance.",
  "Iona Xia, and is a junior at Monta Vista.  Iona is the Secretary/Treasurer of MV Bookshelf.  She love reading books and writing short stories in my free time!  She's excited to work with everyone this year!",
  "Anna is currently a junior and MV Bookshelf’s social media manager. At Monta Vista, she is a member of the varsity field hockey team and is a sports editor for El Estoque. In her free time, she enjoys playing the piano, watching sunrises, and reading memoirs.",
  "Mulyn and is the project manager of the Monta Vista Bookshelf Club. Shes a huge reader and currently working on writing a fantasy novel of my own in my free time!",
  "Lavinia Lei is the Bookshelf’s curriculum head. She enjoys reading all sorts of books (read: fiction), yet her choice genre might just be realistic fiction. Then again, despite being a junior in high school, her favorite book is The Tale of Despereaux; perhaps children’s fantasy is her real number one choice deep down inside. She thinks that reading is underrated and that books are cool, but she is of the humble opinion that PTJ webtoons happen to be the very best. Books are still very cool, though.",
